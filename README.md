# MinimalFPSTemplate
A modification of the standard Unreal Engine FPS template which removes all unnecessary bloat assets/code/files (VR support, meshes, animations etc.)

## Installation
Copy folder "TP_FirstPersonBP_Minimal" to "[YOUR_UE_ENGINE_PATH]\Templates". For example, the default template path for a UE 4.27 would be "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.27\Templates".

The template should now show in the list of templates the next time you try to create a project. It's name will be "First Person (Minimal)".

### Note
After you create a project using the template, the project might complain that it's failing to load the level "BuildData" (lightning data). Nothing to worry about. To fix this, simply rebuild the lightning (by clicking the "Build" button in the upper right corner of the editor).
